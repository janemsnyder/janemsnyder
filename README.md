### Hello!  

Jane here, thank you for taking the time to view my profile.  I am studying to be a data scientist: one of my favorite things to do is to dissect gnarly problems.  My goal is to simplify what's complex so as to make the topic easy to understand, and straightforward to respond to.  

To illustrate, I'll share an example from before I began studying data science (as I am still new to the field and I have not yet dived deeply into independent analysis projects).  I worked with a tech company for 4.5 years and during my tenure there, I was proud to have created an operations managements system that standardized the preparatory process of all outgoing products.  For example, a unit would be assembled for shipping to a client - what channels would each of the sensors be assigned to? which alarms would each unit receive? what is the best way to communicate the standards to the client? what would be the best way to maintain consistent standards across hundreds, even thousands, of unit installs?  The system I built prescribed precisely those operational standards, and thanks to how easy it is to use and how scaleable its application, it is still in use at the tech company today.  

I am currently studying with the Bloom Institute of Technology, and am learning about predictive modeling as well as the ins and outs of coding in Python.
